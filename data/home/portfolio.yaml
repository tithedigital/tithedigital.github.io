      Tithe makes it easier than ever to to support the causes most important to you while watching your money grow. Many Canadians want to financially support charitable organizations, but large one-time or monthly recurring donations can be inaccessible for most, especially younger supporters. 

      Simply deposit into your Tithe account and allocate your money to a list of verified organizations. On a monthly basis, a portion of the interest gained on your deposit will automatically go to the organizations of your choosing with the remainder going back into your account.

      Whenever you need that money elsewhere, you can withdraw at any time to your other bank accounts via Interac e-Transfer.

      You're always seeking income to fund operations, pay staff, or launch projects. One time donations are more accessible to supporters with less reliable income, but they are sporadic, so you can't reliably plan nor factor in these donors as official members.

      At Tithe, we help you do more by lowering the barriers to financial contribution from your supporters to unlock previously inaccessible income.
