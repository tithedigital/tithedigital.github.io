      Tithe offers an easy way to support causes important to you while your money grows. Many Canadians want to financially support charitable organizations, but large one-time or monthly recurring donations can be inaccessible for most, especially younger supporters.

      Deposit into your Tithe account and allocate your money to a list of verified organizations. Each month, a portion of the interest gained goes to your selected organizations, with the rest returning to your account.

      Withdraw money from your Tithe account at any time via Interac e-Transfer.

      Thank you for doing your part in making the world a better place. Let us do our part in helping you achieve your goals. 

      Currently, the most accessible donation option for many Canadians is a one time donation. These sources of funds are sporadic and unreliable for your organization. 

      Tithe lowers the financial barriers for your supporters by unlocking income from their previously inaccessible funds.
